Two switches :
 - KC : KeyCount  ( default : close )
 - KE : KeyEnable ( default : open )

When the cursor is moved away from its initial position : KeyEnable is closed.
When it's released : series of N 'open' pulses on KeyCount.
N is equal to the selected number, except for zero which is coded as 10 pulses.
When it reaches its initial position, KeyEnable open again.

Each pulse last ~60ms.
